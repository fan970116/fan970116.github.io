Hello! I'm a second-year MPhil student in [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) and [Prof. Kaishun WU](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/WU-Kaishun/wuks). Before I started my research in HCI, I got my bachelor's degree in Architecture from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) and worked as an assistant architect in [PT DESIGN](http://www.ptma.com.cn/aspx/index.aspx?language=1).

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Virtual Reality, Accessibility, and Human-AI Interaction. I'm working on the modeling of human behavior in Human-AI Interaction.
