                <!-- <p>College students access information from diverse sources like academic databases, social media, and textbooks. This varied landscape offers more learning opportunities but also challenges, including source credibility assessment and information integration. AI tools have the potential to alleviate these challenges by streamlining information processes for students. However, existing AI tools are not yet optimized for handling multi-source information challenges in academic settings. To address this gap, we conducted a two-phase study. Firstly, we conducted focus group workshops to explore students’ multi-source information behaviors in AI-assisted learning environments. Secondly, we held participatory design workshops to gather design considerations to address current challenges. Our analysis revealed a framework of students’ multi-source information behaviors comprising four key phases: Search, Read, Extract, and Manage. These insights provide practical guidance for enhancing AI-assisted academic tools, ultimately improving students’ multi-source information retrieval and management experiences.</p> -->

                <p>Despite the rise of digital libraries and online reading platforms, physical libraries still offer unique benefits for education and community engagement. However, due to the convenience of digital resources, physical library visits, especially by college students, have declined. This underscores the need to better engage these users. Augmented Reality (AR) could potentially bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. In this paper, we present Augmented Library, an HMD-based AR system designed to revitalize the physical library experience. By creating interactive features that enhance book discovery, encourage community engagement, and cater to diverse user needs, Augmented Library combines digital convenience with physical libraries’ rich experiences. This paper discusses the development of the system and preliminary user feedback on its impact on student engagement in physical libraries.</p>

                <p>May WANG, Bingjie DENG*, <strong>Pengqi WANG</strong></p>
                <p>The 24rd International Conference on Electronic Business (ICEB 2024), Zhuhai, China, Oct 2024.</p>
                <p><a href="../files/a2-FromHallucination.pdf">PDF</a></p>
                <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced user interactions across various platforms, becoming indispensable in sectors like customer service for their immediate response capabilities and personalized assistance. Despite their transformative impact, LLMs occasionally produce hallucinations - factually incorrect, inconsistent, or entirely fabricated, despite appearing plausible or coherent, which might undermine user trust. This type of information manifests as either factuality or faithfulness hallucinations, where responses are factually incorrect or contextually irrelevant, respectively. This study explores different dialogue strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as logical reasoning and empathy expressions, to mitigate these issues. CoT reasoning enhances transparency in AI's decision-making process, potentially reducing the occurrence and impact of hallucinations. Empathy in responses aims to maintain user connection, softening the impact of misinformation and fostering a more forgiving user perspective. Based on the Emotion as Social Information (EASI) theory, this research examines how these strategies can enhance the user experience of LLMs in critical interaction scenarios, contributing to the development of sophisticated, trustworthy, and user-centric AI systems. The findings are expected to inform future designs of LLM architectures and interaction strategies that prioritize both accuracy and the emotional dynamics of user engagement, enhancing the overall acceptance and effectiveness of LLM technologies in everyday applications.</p>

                <p>May WANG, Na JIANG, <strong>Pengqi WANG</strong>, Bingqing XIONG</p>
                <p>2024 UNNC-CNAIS Paper Development Workshop, Ningbo, China, July 2024. (Conference Mentor: Atreyi Kankanhalli)</p>
                <p><a href="../files/PublishedPapers/a3-Enhancing Well-Being and Reliance on AIGC-Powered Digital Assistants.pdf">PDF</a></p>
                <p>The ability of AIGC-powered digital assistants to enhance productivity, user experience, and creativity, combined with their growing ubiquity and the accelerated pace of adopting AI, has made their integration imperative across a wide range of practical applications. The burgeoning market for Digital Assistants is on a trajectory to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.62% by the year 2030 (Technavio 2023). Digital assistants have the potential to positively impact user well-being by automating repetitive tasks, improving productivity, and providing personalized support. However, the extent of this positive impact needs to be empirically investigated. Users have expressed worries about the transparency of how digital assistants work and a fear of losing control of the technology. An important concern revolves around the perceived explainability and transparency of AIGC operations, often referred to as the "illusion effect". On the other hand, the design of empathetic and adaptive interaction can also improve perceived social support and well-being. Investigating these factors can inform the design of more supportive digital assistants. This research endeavor aims to delve into the intricate interplay between the explainability signals and the dialogue strategy in shaping user well-being and reliance on digital assistants. By unraveling these dynamics, we aspire to uncover strategies to refine the design of AIGC-powered digital assistants, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and contributing positively to their overall quality of life (Aimuengheuwa 2024).</p>

                <p><strong>Pengqi WANG</strong>, Yue LIN, Junyi CHAI</p>
                <p>IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC 2023), Hawaii, USA, October 2023.</p>
                <p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10394573">Page</a>, <a href="../files/PublishedPapers/a6-Unmasking_Deception.pdf">PDF</a></p>
                <p>The increasing prevalence of fake online reviews jeopardizes firms' profits, consumers' well-being, and the trustworthiness of e-commerce ecosystems. We face the significant challenge of accurately detecting fake reviews. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive investigation of traditional and state-of-the-art machine learning models in classification, based on textual features, to detect fake online reviews. We attempt to examine existing and noteworthy models for fake online review detection, in terms of the effectiveness of textual features, the efficiency of sampling methods, and their performance of detection. Adopting a quantitative and data-driven approach, we scrutinize both tree-based and transformer-based detection models. Our comparative studies evidence that transformer-based models (specifically BERT and GPT-3) outperform tree-based models (i.e., Random Forest and XGBoost), in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. We use real data from online reviews on Yelp.com for implementation. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach can identify fraudulent reviews effectively and efficiently. Synthesizing ChatGPT-3, tree-based, and transformer-based models for fake online review detection is rather new but promising, this paper highlights their potential for better detection of fake online reviews.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/isemss-22/125981960">Page</a>, <a href="../files/PublishedPapers/a5-Assessing the Content Topics of the Educational Videos on Tik Tok for Science Communication.pdf">PDF</a></p>
                <p>Short video platforms like Tik Tok are becoming an increasingly crucial educational platform that fosters learning on demand with educational science videos. Educational videos are perceived as a productive strategy to enhance the users’ scientific knowledge and even are applied in some academic scenarios. This study provides an overview of science communication videos on Tik Tok information management and assesses the content topics based on user engagement, time, creator, and textual features. Seven main content topics are identified: Healthcare, Trivia, Nature, Astronomy, Social Science, Engineering, and Agriculture. Further findings demonstrate that topics vary significantly in terms of user engagement features: Topics on Healthcare and Trivia receive more likes, comments, and shares, whereas Social Science, Engineering, and Agriculture attract fewer engagements. Moreover, videos on the Healthcare topic have shorter durations, more followers, more concise video titles, and a smaller number of hashtags. We further elaborated on each topic, combined with the existing literature on related fields of information management.</p>
