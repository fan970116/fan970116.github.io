            <p>This project is strategically positioned near Guangzhou Tower, bordered by a residential area and overlooking the Pearl River. The design concept focuses on integrating the building with the urban skyline, respecting the local community, and maximizing river views. The super high-rise structure features stacked volumes, with office blocks interspersed with unique spaces: a showroom for the headquarters and a communal space for leased offices. The design highlights an open and innovative corporate image while providing sky terraces for enhanced views and comfort. The podium is designed as a porous structure, encouraging public interaction and seamlessly connecting the residential area with the waterfront.</p>
